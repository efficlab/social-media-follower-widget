# social-media-follower-widget
A Scriptable script for the IOS widget that displays the followers on **Bilibili** and **YouTube**.

This script requires a Google API Key to fetch the YouTube channel data which needs to be done first by following: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started 

Then modify below fields in the scripts to yours:

- **NAME**: your channel name.
- **CHANNEL_AVATAR_URL**: the URL of your channel logo, you need to get this with the Browser inspector.
- **BILI_UID**: your Bilibili channel UID.
- **YT_API_KEY**: your Google API Key for YouTube.
- **YT_CHANNEL_ID**: your YouTube channel ID.

Next, load the modified script into **Scriptable** app which is installed on your cell phone.

Finally, you can put the script widget on the home screen and see the result just like below:
